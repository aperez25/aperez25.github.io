Among the things I wasn't prepared for starting CB was the amount of tools I'd be installing. Here are three you'll probably use regardless of which CB you attend:

## Don't Be _bashful_

A shell is a program that executes text commands. The standard OS X shell (i.e. the one installed on Macs) is called Bash. You'll hear "open your terminal" a lot, which is basically the UI for your shell. Terminals look something like this:

It's intimidating because instead of pointing and clicking to open folders and find files, you're typing in commands. Will you break your computer? Probably not.

Here are some basic bash commands to play around with:
- ls => "list" files and folders for your current directory
- cd <folderName> => "change directory" to folderName 
	- example: cd Downloads
- mkdir => "make directory" creates a folder
	- example: mkdir MyStuff makes a new folder called MyStuff
- touch <fileName> creates or updates a file
	- example: touch index.js makes a new js file 
- pwd => "print working directory" i.e. it prints the file path
	- example: pwd outputs "/Users/your_username/Downloads"
