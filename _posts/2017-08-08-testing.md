In the spirit of _always be improving_ I completed Udacity's Javascript Testing Course. My short review follows!

## My two cents: 

If you're an absolute beginner i.e. have never touched Jasmine/Mocha/Chai/Sinon/etc. this course is a good starting place for learning Jasmine and understanding what TDD is. It's about 3 hours long, and if you watch the YouTube videos at 1.5+ speed, you'll get done faster. There's only one GitHub repo to work through and it's a follow-along kind of deal. 

If you're looking to sharpen your TDD skills, this isn't the course unfortunately. The red-green-refactor cycle is introduced, but for me, that was more putting a term to something I already knew. For the uninitiated: 

- Red: Create a test and make it fail (i.e. write the test)
- Green: Make the test pass
- Refactor: Improve code design while ensuring that all tests still pass

I was looking for a more thorough explanation/framework of TDD in the context of building an app from scratch and other best practices when working with outside libraries and APIs. The course says it covers async testing which is what lured me in ('async testing with just Jasmine? Cool!'). But the lesson was basically, "Use `setTimeout`!" Womp. 

Did I finish the course? Yes. Was I better for it? Not really. 

I'll keep my eyes open for other TDD resources. So far, Steve McConnell's <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Code-Complete-Practical-Handbook-Construction/dp/0735619670">_Code Complete_</a> has been the best resource, but I would love something more hands on.

_Feedback for the instructors:_ A completed test suite for their course example would be very helpful for those starting out with testing - otherwise I can see people finishing this course and thinking "hope I did this right..."
