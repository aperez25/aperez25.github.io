Deciding to restart your career is a tough decision, and once you realize how many resources there are to learn programming, it's very easy to get overwhelmed. Here's what I wish I had heard before I prepped and interviewed for a coding bootcamp (CB):

## Parlais Vous Ruby?
When you decided on learning to code, you probably followed that decision by googling "What coding language should I learn?". And then you probably read that it's easy to pick-up different languages once you understand some basic but very important concepts for programming, such as:
-data types
-loops
-functions
(And if you are like me, you scoffed and kept reading Google results anyway.) But the people who say this are right. Why?

Unlike spoken language, it's much easier to read and write new programming languages once you have a decent grasp on programming concepts. So, I think when it comes to learning to code you should pay more attention to which resources teach you the foundations i.e. the ones where you understand not just _how to do something_, but _how it works and why it's important_. If you find yourself writing code that you're just parroting back from a tutorial, that's probably not the best resource for you.

You'll find that bootcamps tend to teach either Javascript or Ruby anyway, and though Javascript is more complicated from a syntax perspective, if you're motivated enough to be applying to CBs, picking up one or the other over a weekend to fill out a coding challenge shouldn't be a problem. It's also likely that the CBs you're applying to have their own prep course anyway, making things even easier. Here are a few that do for free:

-[Flatiron School Prep Course](https://flatironschool.com/programs/online-bootcamp-prep-course/)

-[Hack Reactor Prep Program](http://www.hackreactor.com/prep-programs)

-[Viking Code School Prep](https://www.vikingcodeschool.com/prep)

Which brings me to my next realization...

## Learning All of The Things
Let's say you've already started filling out applications and are at the coding challenge or coding interview stage. You're a nervous wreck thinking about bombing the interview and have started a few different online courses or programs to get you up to speed. You like each one for a different reason, but want to make sure you're spending your time in the right places. You're also thinking about spending a few thousand dollars for the 100% guarantee that you'll get in somewhere. Which one or two do you decide to focus on?

First of all, **save your money**. The only way it makes sense to pay for a prep is that it's for 1) the CB you are sure you want to go to and 2) they rollover the course payment into your admissions fee if you're accepted. I say this because there are just way too many free resources out there that'll teach you the same things. What you're paying for are the interviewing soft skills of:

1. How to psuedo code
2. How to talk out loud about your code
3. Understanding what the code you're writing is doing

But, again, there are a lot of resources to guide you through this. I found Hack Reactor's _free_ prep particularly helpful for the first two points because they provided some guidelines in their later modules and a lot of repetition for the kinds of toy problems you see in CB interviews in general. Here is the [Google Doc they shared for outlining](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KlU7nxRKiicGSsMN89mog06GozqfYlyh0L3DRC3WYFk/edit) for example.

To the last point, this is a lot tougher since everyone learns differently. I've heard great things about [Harvard/edX's CS50 course](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x), but timeline wise this didn't fit with what I was aiming for: I started studying in January with the aim of knowing where I was going by March. I had already had a lot of starts and stops; just four months before I had started studying JS than didn't follow through with interviews. That helped, but overall this was a really tight, self-imposed schedule. If you can spread it over a longer period of time, I would. What I ended up doing was using Eloquent Javascript, Medium/blog posts to dive deeper into Javascript methods [like this](https://medium.com/@joshpitzalis/reduce-f47a7da511a9), and a lot of Codewars & Coderbyte.

##But  the reality, and the single best piece of advice I saw, was that you **WILL** get stuck during the CB interview. 

This is why having an understanding of what the code is doing is so important. But that's a topic for another post...
