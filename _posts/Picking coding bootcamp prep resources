Deciding to restart your career is a tough decision, and once you realize how many resources are out there to learn how to program, it's very easy to get overwhelmed. Here's what I wish I had heard before I prepped, interviewed, and was accepted to a coding bootcamp (CB):

## Parlais Vous Ruby? 
When you decided on learning to code, it's pretty likely you followed that decision by googling "What coding language should I learn?" And then you probably read that it's easy to pick-up different languages once you understand some basic but very important concepts for programming, such as:
-data types
-loops
-functions
(And if you are like me, you scoffed and kept reading Google results.) But the people who say this are right. Why? 

Unlike spoken language, it's much easier to read and write new programming languages once you have a decent grasp on programming concepts. So, I think when it comes to learning to code you should pay more attention to which resources teach you the foundations i.e. the ones where you understand not just _how to do something_, but _how it works and why it's important_. If you find yourself writing code that you're just parroting back from a tutorial, that's probably not the best resource for you.

You'll find that bootcamps tend to teach either Javascript or Ruby anyway, and though Javascript is more complicated from a syntax perspective, if you're motivated enough to be applying to CBs, picking up one or the other over a weekend to fill out a coding challenge shouldn't be a problem. It's also likely that the CBs you're applying to have their own prep course anyway, making things even easier. Here are a few that do for free: 

-[Flatiron School Prep Course](https://flatironschool.com/programs/online-bootcamp-prep-course/)

-[Hack Reactor Prep Program](http://www.hackreactor.com/prep-programs)

-[Viking Code School Prep](https://www.vikingcodeschool.com/prep)

Which brings me to my next realization...

## Free prep courses vs. paid prep courses vs. Codeacademy vs MOOCs
Let's say you've already start filling out applications and are at the coding challenge or coding interview stage. You're a nervous wreck thinking about bombing the interview and have started a few different online courses or programs to learn to code. You like each one for a different reason, but want to make sure you're spending your time in the right places. You're also thinking about spending a few $K for the 100% guarantee that you'll get in somewhere. Which one or two do you decide to focus on? 

First of all, save your money, unless the prep course is for the CB you are sure you want to go to and they offer to rollover the payment into your admissions fee if you're accepted. I say this because there are just way too many free resources out there that'll teach you the same things as the prep course. What you're paying for is most likely the soft skills: 

1. How to psuedo code
1. How to talk out loud about your code 
1. Understanding what the code you're writing is doing

But, again, there are a lot of resources to guide you through this. I found Hack Reactor's free prep particularly helpful for the first two points, because they provided some guidelines. Here is the [Google Doc they shared for solving toy problems](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KlU7nxRKiicGSsMN89mog06GozqfYlyh0L3DRC3WYFk/edit) for example.
