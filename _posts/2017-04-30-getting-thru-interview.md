## Prepping Tips

Viking Code School's post on ['Surviving the Interview'](https://www.vikingcodeschool.com/posts/surviving-the-coding-interview) is a great overview for understanding what the interview is like from a coding bootcamp's perspective. They have a ton of great resources in that post, so read that first and then come back over here :)

To build off of how to push forward when you get stuck, and if you're learning Javascript, I would suggest focusing on the following concepts after you master the basics: 
1. Closures: How does this apply to functions?
2. Scope: In relation to closures, how does this affect variable visibility? 
3. Prototypal inheritance: Learn about the relationship between JS Classes & Objects
4. Recursion: This was the main focus of my coding interview! 
5. Higher order functions: What does it mean to be a higher-order function, and how are they composed?
6. Callbacks and their relationship to higher order functions
7. Anonymous functions as variables: How and when do you use anonymous functions?
8. Iteration through different types of collections
9. Built-in methods for arrays, strings and objects

If you're comfortable at working through and understanding how each of these work, it will be much easier to 1) collaborate with your interviewer, 2) ask him/her the right questions as you tackle the coding challenge, and 3) give you the ability to apply their suggestions.

## "Do you have any questions for me?"

The interviewer's main objective is to determine whether you'd mesh well with the CB's learning style, master their material, and have the drive for the job search afterwards. Remember, these are for-profit companies, so the good CBs will want to make sure you can actually get a job afterwards. Your success becomes their success since most share their placement numbers on their site and with future students. 

### Here are three general questions you should definitely prepare answers to: 
- Why do you want to learn to program? 
- Tell me about yourself and your career before this. 
- Why this program? What do you like best about us?
- What resources have you used to learn so far? 

### Questions you should be asking
- Research your interviewer: find their LinkedIn profile and Github. Most interviewers are previous attendees of the CB you're interviewing for. 
	- Why did s/he choose CB over other bootcamps? 
    - If you could go back in time before starting, what advice would you give yourself? 
    - What was your capstone project during CB? (Research this one - some CBs have group projects vs. personal capstone projects, or a combination of both)
- How do you measure the quality of the instructors? 
	- Is there any instructor turnover? How often and why do they leave? 
    - What's the typical instructor-to-student ratio? If I need 1:1 help, is that easy to get? 
	- What kind of support do they offer for students if they start to fall behind during the program?
- For their job placement percentages, what does "gain employment" mean to them? 
	- How are the hiring statistics calculated?
    - Does the school count people who; accept short-term positions like internships or contract roles, opt-out of the job search for further study, students who return to their previous job, or students who take a non-coding or coding-related job?
- From the interviewer's perspective, what do they think your most important priorities should be in the short, medium, and long term?
- As s/he looks back at the various students that have gone through the program, what has characterized the outstanding performers?

Remember, you're interviewing them as much as they are interviewing you! Make sure the CB will fit your learning style and will get you the outcome you're looking for.
