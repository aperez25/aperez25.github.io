I had the opportunity through [Girl Develop It SF](https://www.meetup.com/Girl-Develop-It-San-Francisco/) to attend [GitHub's Developer Program](https://developer.github.com/) Workshop: "Build a bot with GitHub and GraphQL". I had heard the hype about GraphQL and was excited to see how it differed from REST APIs.

## REST vs GraphQL - Real World Example

Let's say you're going out to eat. The restaurant you go to has the option between a la carte vs. a prix fixe menu (fancy you). 

On the prix fixe menu, there's an entree you really like, but you're not too happy with the appetizer and drink options. This is like a REST API. You're getting the dish you want but it also comes with some extras you're not looking for. For example, let's say you wanted to get the descriptions and URLs for all of your repositories because you wanted to add them to your personal website. The request is very simple, make a call to: `GET /repositories`

The response from GitHub's REST API for each repo would look something like this: 

```javascript
[
  {
    "id": 1296269,
    "owner": {
      "login": "octocat",
      "id": 1,
      "avatar_url": "https://github.com/images/error/octocat_happy.gif",
      "gravatar_id": "",
      "url": "https://api.github.com/users/octocat",
      "html_url": "https://github.com/octocat",
      "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/octocat/followers",
      "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/octocat/following{/other_user}",
      "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/octocat/gists{/gist_id}",
      "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/octocat/starred{/owner}{/repo}",
      "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/octocat/subscriptions",
      "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/octocat/orgs",
      "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/octocat/repos",
      "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/octocat/events{/privacy}",
      "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/octocat/received_events",
      "type": "User",
      "site_admin": false
    },
    "name": "Hello-World",
    "full_name": "octocat/Hello-World",
    "description": "This your first repo!",
    "private": false,
    "fork": false,
    "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/octocat/Hello-World",
    "html_url": "https://github.com/octocat/Hello-World"
  }
]
```
So, you're getting a ton of extra info even though you know exactly what fields you want.

**Okay, back to our example:**

After your okay experience with the restaurant's prix fixe menu, at your next visit you decide to order off the a la carte menu instead. You order the entree you like, along with the drink you've had your eye on, and decide to skip the appetizer. This is GraphQL. 

Information is still organized in specific ways (appetizer vs. entree vs. drinks), but you're able to get back exactly what you're looking for by the way you write your query. So, to get the descriptions for all of your repos along with the URLs would look something like this: 

```javascript
{
  viewer {
    repositories(first:100) {
      edges {
        node {
          description
          url
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This looks pretty similar to a Javascript object with the exception of the edges and node values. Basically, nodes describe the objects we care about (viewer, repositories, description, url) and edges describe the relationships between those nodes. Why have edges? Well, the edges have their own metadata, so if we wanted to get a value - maybe our total count of repositories - we could just get it from that specific edge instead of calculating the value ourselves. Woo!

The response from the GraphQL would look something like this: 

```javascript
{
  "data": {
    "viewer": {
      "repositories": {
        "edges": [
          {
            "node": {
              "description": "Here is our first result",
              "url": "https://github.com/aperez25/result1"
            }
          },
          {
            "node": {
              "description": "Here is another one!",
              "url": "https://github.com/aperez25/result2"
            }
          },
          {
            "node": {
              "description": "Saving the best for last",
              "url": "https://github.com/aperez25/result3"
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
```

So, we're getting exactly the information we're looking for, nothing extra baked in. 

## TLDR: 

For me, the ability to get only the information you want was the was the biggest advantage of GraphQL.
