Among the things I wasn't prepared for starting CB was the amount of tools I'd be installing. Here are three you'll probably use regardless of which CB you attend:

## Don't be _bashful_

You might already know that a shell is a program that executes text commands. The standard OS X shell (i.e. the one installed on Macs) is called Bash. You'll hear "open your terminal" a lot during CB, which is basically the UI for your shell. Terminals look something like this:

It's intimidating because instead of pointing and clicking to open folders and find files, you're typing in commands. But will you break your computer? Probably not.

Here are some basic bash commands to play around with in the terminal:
- `ls` "list" files and folders for your current directory
- `cd <folderName>` "change directory" to folderName 
	- example: `cd Downloads`
- `mkdir` => "make directory" creates a folder
	- example: `mkdir MyStuff` makes a new folder called MyStuff
- `touch <fileName>` creates or updates a file
	- example: `touch index.js` makes a new Javascript file 
- `pwd` => "print working directory" i.e. it prints the file path
	- example: `pwd` outputs "/Users/your_username/Downloads"


A comprehensive list can be found on this [cheat sheet](https://learncodethehardway.org/unix/bash_cheat_sheet.pdf).

## Replacing repl.it 
Up until CB prep work I had been using some sort of coding interface, mainly repl.it, to write and run coding problems. This quickly changed once my CB prep work required Github repo's (my next section) and  I needed to pick a text editor. The one's I've heard mentioned the most are [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/) and [Visual Studio Code(VSC)](https://code.visualstudio.com/). 

My brother, who's studying Computer Sciemce, is using VSC, so I went with that. The biggest difference I've noticed between VSC and Sublime is that VSC has a "Code Runner" extension that works in the editor itself - really helpful when you're testing and debugging. 

Other than that, I think it's all about personal preference, as both have lots of packages/extensions to make writing code easier. 

## Git
