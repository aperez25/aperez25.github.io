I've been hesitant to go to any meetups, conferences, etc. because I was afraid I couldn't hold my own in a conversation with an **actual** engineer. I bit the bullet and attended a coder's summit this past Saturday, and can't recommend it enough. Surprisingly, most of the advice was focused on soft skills. Here are my takeaways:

## "Be in your own Corner"
This piece of advice ties into imposter syndrome / lack of confidence. No one does everything perfectly, so don't harp on your mistakes (we all have to start somewhere right?). A good way to catch yourself is to think of a role model or peer and ask yourself, "If I was so-and-so, would I be holding myself back?"

## "Change Faster than the World is Changing"

You should be constantly reinventing your skillset - learning new tools, new design patterns, etc. Start trying to "see around corners" and predict what technologies and trends will be next. if you don't get something, assume there's another way to ask what you're trying to understand. You can do this by experimenting with new libraries, reading Hacker News, and/or following along with tutorials. To really push yourself; if you think something is an amazing piece of technology, reverse engineer it. Then, make it better! 

Giving yourself a benchmark forces you to ask questions and try new learning paradigms.

## "Bring your Heart to the Game"

I think if you're following the above two pieces of advice, this third one comes out organically. Basically, if you're smart and passionate, learn to communicate that. Be confident in your speech and mannerisms. This means things like eliminating "ummms" during public speaking or saying things like "maybe we should do it this way" when you're programming because you're afraid to be wrong. Use your personality and it will take you a long way.
