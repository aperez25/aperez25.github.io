I decided on a remote coding bootcamp program, mainly because I wanted to save on the cost and time of commuting, using that extra time to study. What I didn't anticipate was the amount of prep work there would be before the program even started, and ended up having to quit my job earlier than I anticipated. If you're trying to work as much as you can before your bootcamp starts, here's what I'd like to have done: 

## Set Up Your Home Office Before

Even if you choose an in-person program, you'll still be spending time at home programming or studying. After getting the bootcamp's suggestion on a laptop, I'd set up an area in your room/apartment/house where you can work. That might mean:
- Buying a desk, [external monitor](https://www.cnet.com/topics/monitors/buying-guide/), mouse, mouse pad, office chair, etc. Don't forget about assembly time for the desk and chair (if you order them online). 
	- It's not necessary, but I'd also recommend a whiteboard, so you can psuedo code and practice writing code wihtout the benefit of a [linter](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8503559/what-is-linting). 
    
There won't be a lot of time to do this once your program starts, and you'll get the benefit of having a dedicated area to do your work.
