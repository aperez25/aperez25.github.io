As part of the bootcamp, we're asked to put together Tech Talks. I was inspired by [Software Engineering Daily's podcast on Ransomware](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2017/04/27/ransomware-with-tim-gallo-and-allan-liska/), but little did I know how much information I would be sifting through! 

## “Curiouser and curiouser!” 
The requirements for the Tech Talk were pretty simple - find something interesting to talk about for 10 minutes. And, if you could, do depth over breadth. 

I started by looking at the ransomware lifecycle - from the infection through to the extortion. I realized I didn't know a lot about web security or encryption algorithms, and there was a ton of information out there, so which should I focus on? 

## “Begin at the beginning," the King said, very gravely, "and go on till you come to the end: then stop.” 

Okay, so I didn't pick one. I started looking into both because they were both so interesting! For example, ransomware exploit kits find site vulnerabilites that I hadn't been introduced to. I didn't even know what an exploit kit _was_. And reading the math behind the algorithms made my head spin. I just had to know more about everything before I could decide. 

_I don't necessarily recommend this if you're short on time. But this help solidify my understanding of crypto-ransomware and that made me feel confident I could put together a technical presentation._

## “If you don't know where you are going any road can take you there” 

I started putting together slides and talking through my thinking. 5 stages of ransomware! The types of ransomware! The technologies! The algorithms! All the things! 

My tech talk was really bloated. Like I could talk-for-an-hour-and-fill-the-60-minutes-just-droning-on-and-on bloated. I had to commit to something. 

I chose the algorithms. This was based on the fact that looking at the online articles and research papers made me uncomfortable. I didn't really get what they were saying. And that bugged me. So I dove in.

## “Well, I never heard it before, but it sounds uncommon nonsense.” 

I'd open up a PDF and anything I got stuck on, I googled. What is this math equation doing? What is the XOR operator again? What's block vs stream for symmetric algorithms mean? 

I'd copy and paste the explanations that made sense to me into a doc and keep going. I did this until I fully grasped what was going on. 

This method of learning, recommended by a friend, worked well for me: 
1. When you're reading a technical paper, stop at anything you don't understand and research it until you do
2. Read it a second time and and do step #1 again; you should know 70-80% of the material this time around
3. On the third read, you should understand 90%+ of the material.

Then things started to click.

## “Why, sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.” 

So, now the things I had no idea about a few days ago were starting to make sense! The next step for me was learning to how to explain them simply. I used my fiancee as my guinea pig, but basically it's [the ELI5 method](https://xkcd.com/1364/). 

The slides really started to come together at that point and I was really happy with what I put together. By now, I was starting to practice the actual presentation and working on getting it down to 9 minutes and 30 seconds (so I had a 30 second buffer for online delays and such). 

## “The time has come / The walrus said / To talk of many things: / Of shoes- and ships- / And sealing wax- / Of cabbages and kings-"

Rehearsing was second-nature for me since I was in sales before the bootcamp. As an account executive, I was on phone calls and online demos almost everyday. But here's some advice if you're not as comfortable with the idea of public speaking or presenting online: 
- Rehearse in the mirror or record yourself giving the presentation. and ** WATCH IT. YES, WATCH THE WHOLE THING.**
	- Yes, your voice sounds weird. Yes, you should speak slower. But if you're tuning in-and-out of your own talk, noticing you're tongue-tied, that you're not making eye contact, or that you're just standing in one place for 10 minutes, this is great feedback for you to work with. And it's all coming from you! Which makes it pretty low stakes on the "I'm so embarrassed right now" scale.
- Your slides should be very visual. Don't have a lot of writing on the slides because people will focus on that and not on what you're saying. I really like [Haiku Deck](https://haikudeck.com/) for this reason, and you can also checkout [slides.com](slides.com) as another online presentation tool. 
- If you're really stressed the day of your presentation, remember - **you know everything you need to know.** You've practiced. You've researched the topic in-depth. Hopefully you're passionate and excited about it. That will come through! Your job is to show people why this thing is so cool! And in all likelihood, no one else has _any idea_ what you're talking about. And they have zero expectations for your presentation. Miss a point you wanted to make? Keep going! They have no idea you wanted to say that anyway :)

I had a lot of fun putting my Tech Talk together, and you can see a PDF of my [Tech Talk here](https://github.com/aperez25/cryptoransomwaretechtalk).
