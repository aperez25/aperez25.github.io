title: 'Sales vs. Engineering'

Before I quit my job, I had a conversation with a friend who was a technical recruiter, about whether leaving my sales career to become a software engineer was doable. My friend thought it was "an interesting leap" and that the two trajectories were brain switches that didn't exactly align. At the time, I didn't think it was necessarily true, and _now_ I **definitely** think it isn't true.

## A common mantra...Always Be Learning

Both of these careers require people who are willing to constantly up their game knowledge-wise.

In sales, that's learning about your product, your customers, your competition, and yourself. Basically, each sales cycle is an opportunity to improve. I'd say the mix is 70-80% soft skills and 20-30% hard skills. For instance, as an account executive you're probably more worried about objection handling something like: `What do I say to a potential client when they mention the competition is undercutting our pricing?` versus `How does our API work again? It's REST right?`

To the latter, I wouldn't say it's a lack of interest, but technical questions can easily be deferred with "I don't know, but I can find out," whereas the former might cause the account executive to lose the deal.

From my pinhole view of engineering, I haven't seen one person say/write that they know everything they need to know about all of the technologies they work with and that they are done learning. New concepts, tools, libraries, etc. come out everyday. Just check [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/).

There's a lot of _learn as you go_...remind you of anything?...it's like a sales person iterating through their sales cycles!

For example, while working on a project, it takes you an hour to debug an error (blergh), but because of that you commit the solution to memory. A month later when it pops up again, you know what to do. At work, it's not happening during a sales cycle, but maybe during an AGILE sprint instead.

The big difference between the two, is that the soft skills to hard skills ratio is reversed for an engineer in the beginning, and then seems to balance itself a bit more over time (from what I've read about the SWE career progression).

## "Why can't we all just get along?"

Overall, I think the misconceptions between sales & engineering comes from the fact that sales people are working on improving intangibles most of the time. I've had engineers tell me that sales as an org is not data-driven...that they are like chimpanzees with phones o_O

But, trust me, sales people **TRACK EVERYTHING**. They are obsessed with improving and streamlining as much as engineers - but, singling out why one sales rep performs better than another is a lot harder despite all the metrics.

## TLDR: Sales reps and engineers are both constantly learning new things and honing their skills - their curiousity and expertise drive their success, regardless of role.
