## Putting the _work_ into Networking

What astounds me about the tech industry is how many people are willing to help you; help you sharpen your skills, help you get your foot in the door, help you connect with the right people, etc. But you have to put yourself out there! Here are my tips for finding the right events and making the most out your time there.

## Attend at least 1 event/week

My goal for finding meetups, conferences, and events to go to has been at least one a week since the mid-point of my coding bootcamp experience. One a week keeps you accountable to being involved in the meetup communities and other groups you join along the way. The easiest place to start is [meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com), especially if you're in a metro area. If that doesn't help, looking through [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com), Facebook events, and even just googling has helped me find events to attend.

If an event costs money and you're on a budget or in school, sometimes the organizers offer student scholarships or discounts, so click around on their site and google the event name with the keywords "discount code" and "scholarship" to see if anything pops up. This can also be another way to find groups to become involved with!

## Do your research

Once you've picked the event, take the time to research the speakers or panelists that'll be there. If the event is hosted by a tech company, there's a high chance that a recruiter or engineer will be in attendance. Looking up his/her LinkedIn, checking the company's current available positions, and even looking up the event organizer will 1) help calm your nerves if networking is nerve-wracking for you and 2) makes the best use of your time since you're going in with an idea of what you want out the event. There's nothing worse than standing by yourself, nursing a drink, waiting for the event to start, while there's a buzz of activity around you.

## Be sincerely interested in other people

Even at technical meetups (hackathons, workshops, etc), there's a networking component, and if you're looking to break into the tech industry, most people find their jobs through "friend of a friend" connections. So networking is a great way to start building a community for yourself. If you're stuck on how to start a conversation with fellow attendees, here's a few starter questions to get you going:
- What brings you to the event? What are you looking to get out of it? (these are no-brainers but easy to miss if you're nervous)
- How did you hear about this meetup/event? Do you have any recommendations on other groups like this that you're a part of?
- What's your background and experience? Can I hear more about your career path? (Casual alternative: What's your story?) What do you like best about what you do?

## Keep in touch after the event

A great thing to do after meeting someone interesting is to write down their name and a few notes on what the two of you talked about. This makes it easy to send a personalized connection request on LinkedIn afterwards and will help you remember any resources they pointed you to. Whoever has organized the event usually introduces the organization at the beginning and sends a follow-up email after the event; pay attention to any Slack channels or Facebook groups that they might have. This is an easy way to find out about more events and connect with other members who couldn't attend that specific event but who could potentially help you.


### Remember, "it's not who you know, it's who knows you."
